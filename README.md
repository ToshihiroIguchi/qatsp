## qatsp packages
Quantum annealing for traveling salesman problem.

### Description
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a combination of a set of cities and a distance between each two cities to find the one with the smallest total distance traveled by a tour traveling around all cities just once and returning to the departure place It is an optimization problem.
This problem belongs to the class of NP difficulties in computational complexity theory.

Quantum annealing is a metaheuristic for finding the global minimum of a given objective function over a given set of candidate solutions, by a process using quantum fluctuations.

The qatsp package simulates quantum annealing in the R language and can approximate the traveling salesman problem.
Quantum Monte Carlo method is used for simulation of quantum annealing.

I refer to "[Combinatorial optimization with quantum annealing](http://qiita.com/ab_t/items/8d52096ad0f578aa2224)" implemented with python.


### Installation
You can install from R console.

If `devtools` is not installed on your PC, install `devtools` with Internet connection.

    install.packages("devtools")

Install from GitHub using `devtools`.
    
    library(devtools)
    install_github("ToshihiroIguchi/qatsp")

Load the `qatsp` package and attach it.

    library(qatsp)

Installation may fail if running under proxy environment.
In that case, you may be able to install using the `httr` package.

### Examples
For reproducibility of results, we set random seeds.

    set.seed(108)
    
Designate city coordinates for x and y to solve the traveling salesman problem.
The length of x and y must be the same.

We will explain by way of example about patrolling municipalities in Akita prefecture.
There are 25 points in this latitude and longitude data.
It seems that [it takes 359 days if supercomputer K calculates the shortest route with brute force.](http://itpro.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/COLUMN/20140514/556564/)
The latitude is stored in `Akita [, 1]`. Longitude is stored in `Akita [, 2]`.

    result <- qatsp(x = Akita[,1], y= Akita[,2])

By default, `trace = TRUE`, and the transition of the shortest distance during calculation is displayed on the graph.
Optionally, by setting `route = TRUE`, the shortest route is displayed every time the shortest route is updated during calculation.

The shortest path obtained by the `route` function is displayed.

    route(result)

The transition of the shortest distance is displayed by the `plot` function.

    plot(result)
